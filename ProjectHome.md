a gui library for the programming environment processing. The controlP5 website can be found at [www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5).

ControlP5 is a GUI and controller library for [processing](http://www.processing.org) that can be used in application, applet and android mode. Controllers such as Sliders, Buttons, Toggles, Knobs, Textfields, RadioButtons, Checkboxes amongst others are easily added to a processing sketch. They can be arranged in separate control windows, and can be organized in tabs or groups.


**Automatic controller-event detection**

ControlP5 offers a range of controllers that allow you to easily change and adjust values while your sketch is running. Each controller is identified by a unique name assigned when creating a controller. ControlP5 locates variables and functions inside your sketch and will link controllers to matching variables or functions automatically. Controller changes can easily be captured within your sketch by implementing the controlEvent function.


**Show, hide, load, save**

Controllers that have been added to your sketch can be arranged in tabs and groups to keep your controller sets organized. All controllers are drawn on top of a processing sketch by default. Several key combinations allow you to show and hide the user interface, and to saved and loaded ControlP5 properties
